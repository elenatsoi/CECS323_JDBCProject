F1 :    I'm a typical man's man.

F2 :    Sometime I go to the track with my buddies and we ride dirt bikes.

F3 :    I grew up with four brothers.  We did boy things.

F1 :    Sundays are always football.  Now... that gets interrupted with a
        little um... Barbie time.

F1 :    I'm here to see the doctor.

D1 :    She'll see you in a minute.

F1 :    Okay I'll wait here


F2 :    Love playing Barbie.  But I only play with Ken.  Ken only.


F2 :    Help!  There's a fire!  My building!

D2 :                                       (spraying water sounds)

F2 :                                            Help!


F4 :    Amanda what qualities do you need to be an astronaut.

D4 :    Well, you need good eyesight.  50/50 eyesight.


D3 :    Now I want you to put your hands like this.  And hum.  (hums)

F3 :                                                           (hums)  (laughs)


F1 :    Is the doctor ready yet?

D1 :    Not yet.


F5 :    I think she can be anything she wants to be or all of them.


D5 :    What is 30 plus 1?

F5 :                      Ooh!  Ooh!

D5 :                                Yes?

F5 :                                     Um... thirty-one?

D5 :                                                      That's right?

F5 :                                                                    Right.

D5 :    Yes!

F5 :        Oh good!  Woohoo!


F1 :    You would do anything.  Anything to make her happy.


F1 :    I'm feeling a little sick.  I have a sore throat and a cough.  I might
        have a fever.

D1 :    Let me check your heart.  Oh my!  You are truly sick!

F1 :                                                         Well what should
        I do?

D1 :    Take a bunny.
